Adaptiva provides unrivaled serverless endpoint management that eliminates the need for a vast IT infrastructure and monitors itself by automating traditionally manual tasks. Leveraging innovative peer-to-peer protocols, the Adaptiva Edge Platform is powered by the surplus capacity of existing devices already on the network – in the office or working from home. This enables IT to continuously deliver software, configurations and patches to endpoints no matter where they are. 

The world’s largest enterprise organizations and government agencies rely on Adaptiva for best-in-class real-time endpoint visibility and content delivery, as well as automated compliance checks, remediations, and patching without ever throttling the network or the end user experience. Leading global Fortune 1000 organizations including Nokia, HSBC, Walmart, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. State Department use Adaptiva products.

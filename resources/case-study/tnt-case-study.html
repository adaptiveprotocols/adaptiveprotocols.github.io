        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>TNT is one of the world's largest express delivery companies, operating road and air transportation networks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas. TNT had revenues of €6.9 billion in 2015.

                <h2 class="blue">Challenge</h2>
                <p>TNT was unable to effectively deliver software, updates, applications, and other content to its 42,000 endpoints comprised of 3,000 servers and 39,000 Windows systems. The number of systems under management was growing rapidly. The massive server infrastructure was expensive and time consuming to maintain.</p>
        
                <p>Even with all those servers in place, managing WAN traffic presented a dilemma. Administrators either throttled delivery to a fraction of available bandwidth and got content out far too slowly, or they overwhelmed the WAN with systems traffic, impacting business operations.</p>

                <p>TNT consistently saw a large number of failed deployments, making it difficult to deliver software and updates in an acceptable timeframe. The vast infrastructure made troubleshooting a very tedious effort. Poor reporting exacerbated the problem-failed deployments sometimes were reported as successful. </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Working together with Microsoft, HPE, and Computacenter, TNT selected Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012 with the Adaptiva OneSite™ content distribution engine. OneSite solved TNT's challenges by speeding software delivery without the need for additional servers. 
                </p>
                <p>OneSite met or exceeded every requirement, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speed WAN delivery with no throttling / scheduling</li>
                    <li>Deployment of updates to all endpoints instantly (no waiting)</li>
                    <li>Improved content delivery success rates</li>
                    <li>Reduced administrator burden / hours</li>
                    <li>Fast Windows 7/8 operating system deployment (OSD)</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>OneSite's DeployEase feature slashed the Configuration Manager deployment timeframe, allowing TNT to get up and running much more quickly and with less effort. </p>     
                <h3>Solution Components </h3>   
                <p><strong>Microsoft Configuration Manager 2012</strong>  with no remote servers</p>
                <p><strong>Adaptiva OneSite</strong>  for enterprise P2P architecture</p>
                <h2>Results </h2>   
                <p>By deploying Configuration Manager with OneSite, TNT was able to eliminate 430 servers worldwide, as well as the cost of maintenance. This resulted in direct savings of over £1 million, including the OneSite licenses and other costs of the chosen solution.</p>
                <p>The indirect returns on their investment are manyfold, but several stand out. TNT was able to deploy the Configuration Manager in a fraction of the time it would have taken without OneSite. The ongoing administrative burden is much lighter due to OneSite's many automation features. Finally, by having a reliable endpoint management capability that delivers content rapidly with no impact to the WAN, the business runs faster and better. </p>

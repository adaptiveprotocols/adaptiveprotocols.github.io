        <p>A New-York based, Fortune 100 financial services organization was making a significant change to their IT oprations tool set.  they had no room for error because they manage over $1 trillion in combined assets and offer banking services, financial advice and guidance, and retirment services</p>
        <p>The company had recently decided to implement Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) to manage their mission-critical Windows endpoints. ConfigMgr would dramatically improve their operations in numerous ways. However, a couple big challenges remained as they planned to roll it out ot more than 200 facilities with 20,000 endpoints.</p>
        <p>The massive server infrastructure typically required for an enterprise environment would be costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. Without the servers, they would put the WAN at risk with petabytes of global software delivery. Key inititatives, such as Windows 10 deployment, would take years.</p>
        <p>In this case study, you'll see how they saved money, reduced adminstrator workloads, and radically accelerated timelines.</p>

                <h2 class="blue">Challenge</h2>
                <p>The company recognized that a complex ConfigMgr server infrastructure which included dozens of distribution point servers would be required to efficiently deliver software to 200 locations. They were concerned about the costs associated with installing and maintaining those servers as well as the potential network impacts of distributing content enterprise-wide. Large content transfers could put the network at risk, potentially causing slow-downs that would lead to employee productivity issues and critical business traffic being slowed.</p>
        
                <p>The company also wanted to use ConfigMgr to accelerate their migration to Windows 10. They acknowledged that Windows 10 migration would not be simple, especially given the company's exacting security standards. Secure traffic protection and DHCP snooping prevention limited the ability to PXE boot endpoints across multiple subnets. Third-party encryption required reformatting, mandating a state save/restore for every user. </p>

                <p>On top of all that, the company is a dynamic organization that is continuously expanding through mergers and acquisitions. When completing acquisitions, the financial giant would need the flexibility to integrate new endpoints easily without disruption.</p>
                
                <p>The company was determined to get the new ConfigMgr rollout right. They had to minimize IT timelines and costs, while maintaining the highest levels of enterprise security and end user productivity. </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>After careful evaluation of available solutions, the company chose to streamline their ConfigMgr architecture and speed delivery using Adaptiva OneSiteâ„¢. OneSite eliminated the need for dozens of servers at the company by distributing content peer-to-peer. The design placed servers in just three campus locations, rather than the 200 that would have typically been required for their environment. </p>
                <p>The company first tested OneSite's capabilities as part of a limited rollout of ConfigMgr within their organization. The staff watched OneSite deliver large software and update payloads reliably without ever upsetting end users or the network. As a result, they were confident the product would deliver in a mission-critical role of distributing content, operating systems, updates, applications, and other software from peer to peer. </p>
                <p>Administrators had seen how OneSite's peer-to-peer storage was entirely self-forming and self-managing. Predictive bandwidth harvest networking technology had worked the same way, dynamically predicting how much bandwidth would be available and automatically adjusting content distribution rates to match. Administrators didn't need to perform complex setup or constant configuration adjustments. Everything just worked. </p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The combined solution of ConfigMgr with OneSite exceeded original expectations. By pairing OneSite with ConfigMgr, the financial services company:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eliminated 197 servers from the architecture design</li>
                    <li>Improved software delivery rates over their legacy solution by reliably distributing software and updates faster and with greater success rates</li>
                    <li>Protected the network when delivering software and updates globally, without requiring extensive administrative efforts</li>
                    <li>Deployed Windows 10 securely, rapidly, and with less effort using Adaptiva technologies already proven in other Fortune 500 environments</li>
                    <li>Simplified the integration of M&A properties with the ability to easily onboard endpoints into the company at scale</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The company currently runs the Adaptiva solution on 20,000 endpoints. By removing the need for 197 servers, they were able to migrate to ConfigMgr and Windows 10 rapidly and with far less costs than traditional endpoint management methods would typically require.</p>
                <p>The company's Lead Engineer for Unified Client Experience Engineering, remarked "Windows 10 OSD is working great." In particular, he said OneSite's P2P PXE feature let them migrate to Windows 10 without the need for PXE servers and complex configuration tasks. Virtual State Migration points also made it easy to migrate user data and speed a secure Windows 10 deployment. </p>
                <blockquote>
                    We use a third-party encryption process that requires reformatting when migrating from Windows 7 to 10. OneSite makes it easy to move data off through the virtual state migration points, and clean the systems knowing they'll be fully restored and functional afterward
                </blockquote>
                <p><small>-Lead Engineer for Unified Client Experience Engineering</small></p>
                <p>He added that OneSite has also dramatically reduced their administrative effort. 
                    "Things that would take days with a traditional architecture take hours with Adaptiva."</p>

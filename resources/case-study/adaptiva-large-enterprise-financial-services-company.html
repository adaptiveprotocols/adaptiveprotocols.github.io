        <p>This case study of a large North American federation of credit unions is based on a December 2018 survey of Adaptiva customers by TechValidate, a third-party research service.  The profiled company asked to have their name blinded to protect their confidentiality.  The organization is recognized by baner magazine as one of the World's Strongest Banks.</p>

                <h2 class="blue">Challenge</h2>
                <p>The leading financial institution faced several challenges with software delivery for managing Windows endpoints. First, they were frustrated that global software delivery had to be slowed down to avoid impacting the WAN. It is not uncommon for organizations to have to send large amounts of data, sometimes in excess of 5Gb+, across the WAN to keep software and operating systems up to date. This volume can severely impact end user device performance and critical business traffic. </p>
        
                <p>The organization was also challenged by the costly server infrastructure required to ease the WAN traffic burden in a traditional architecture. It is common for companies using the native Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager product to have to place distribution point servers in every office location to ease network bandwidth issues and this can be a large investment.</p>

                <p>On top of that, they felt pressure to deploy Windows 10 at scale within their desired timeframe. The Microsoft end of support date for Windows 7 is January 14, 2020 and this large North American federation of credit union, like so many other organizations, wanted to complete their migration to Windows 10 before that deadline. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Staffing presented a concern as well. They felt they did not have enough staff IT time, though they only considered this to be mildly challenging.  </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>After a thorough evaluation of the solutions available in marketplace, the retailer decided to deploy Adaptiva Endpoint HealthTM on roughly 10% of their production systems. The company had eliminated nearly all ConfigMgr server infrastructure and radically accelerated software deployment speeds by using Adaptiva OneSite. They were familiar with Adaptiva’s industry-leading engineering, advanced automation, and demonstrable return on investment.</p>
                <p>OneSite enabled the federation of credit unions to replace servers with peer-to-peer storage by using the product's self-managing Virtual SAN. This unique storage technology caches content on unallocated disk space on endpoints at a location, creating a virtual SAN. This instantly creates massive amounts of redundant storage at every facility worldwide while taking no disk space from end users. </p>
                <p>OneSite protects the WAN from impacts. Adaptiva's proprietary Predictive Bandwidth Harvesting technology speeds delivery by utilizing the maximum amount of bandwidth available without negatively impacting other critical WAN traffic. It dynamically predicts the amount of traffic anticipated on the WAN, end-to-end, down to the millisecond. Then it transmits each individual data packet only when there is free bandwidth available on the network. This means there is no need for throttling like with BITS and other TCP-based solutions. There is also no need to schedule content delivery and software updates only at night to avoid network impacts. </p>
                <p>OneSite improves delivery success rates, which provides a better experience for end users and requires less IT staff time for troubleshooting failed deliveries. On top of that, OneSite automates common tasks, further saving precious IT staff time. 
                </p>
                <p>OneSite speeds Windows 10 OSD timelines by automating the deployment process.</p>
